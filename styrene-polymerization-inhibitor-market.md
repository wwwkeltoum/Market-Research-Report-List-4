<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Styrene Polymerization Inhibitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Inactive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Styrene polymerization inhibitor market can be classified into two types: active and inactive. Active inhibitors are chemicals that directly react with styrene monomers to prevent polymerization, thus acting as effective stabilizers. Inactive inhibitors, on the other hand, work by absorbing free radicals that initiate polymerization reactions in styrene. While active inhibitors are more commonly used due to their higher efficiency in preventing polymerization, inactive inhibitors also play a crucial role in stabilizing styrene during storage and transportation. Both types are essential in ensuring the quality of styrene products.</p></p>
