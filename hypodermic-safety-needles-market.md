<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hypodermic Safety Needles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Safety Needles</li><li>Passive Safety Needles</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hypodermic safety needles are divided into two main types: active safety needles and passive safety needles. Active safety needles have a mechanism that automatically shields the needle after use, reducing the risk of accidental needlestick injuries. Passive safety needles, on the other hand, require manual activation to retract or cover the needle post-use. Both types of safety needles aim to enhance healthcare worker safety, prevent needlestick injuries, and reduce the transmission of bloodborne pathogens.</p></p>
