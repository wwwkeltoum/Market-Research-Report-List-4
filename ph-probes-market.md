<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PH Probes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Refillable</li><li>Refillable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PH probes are available in two main market types: non-refillable and refillable. Non-refillable probes are disposable units that are discarded once the pH sensor is depleted, making them convenient for one-time use applications. Refillable probes, on the other hand, feature a replaceable filling solution that allows the probe to be refilled once it is depleted, making them a more cost-effective and environmentally friendly option for long-term use. Both types offer accurate pH measurement capabilities for various industrial and research applications.</p></p>
