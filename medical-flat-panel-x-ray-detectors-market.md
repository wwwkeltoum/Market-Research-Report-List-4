<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Flat Panel X Ray Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion</li><li>Direct Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Medical flat panel X-ray detectors are categorized into two types: indirect conversion and direct conversion. Indirect conversion detectors use a two-step process where X-rays are first converted into visible light using a scintillator, which is then detected by a photodetector to generate an image. In contrast, direct conversion detectors convert X-rays directly into electrical signals, enhancing image quality and reducing noise. Both technologies are integral to modern radiography, improving the efficiency and accuracy of medical imaging.</p></p>
