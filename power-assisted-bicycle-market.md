<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Power Assisted Bicycle Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mid-Drive</li><li>Hub-Drive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Power-assisted bicycles come in two main types - mid-drive and hub-drive. Mid-drive bicycles have the motor located in the center of the bike's frame, directly connected to the pedals. This allows for a more natural riding experience as the motor can take advantage of the bike's gears. On the other hand, hub-drive bicycles have the motor located in the hub of either the front or rear wheel. This type is typically simpler and more affordable, but may not offer as seamless of a riding experience as mid-drive bikes.</p></p>
