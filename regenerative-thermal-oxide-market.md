<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Regenerative Thermal Oxide Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotary</li><li>Compact</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Regenerative Thermal Oxidizers (RTOs) are commonly classified into two types based on their design: Rotary RTOs and Compact RTOs. Rotary RTOs feature a wheel-like rotor that helps in heat transfer and oxidation of pollutants, making them suitable for high air flow rates and low concentration of pollutants. On the other hand, Compact RTOs are smaller in size and more efficient, making them ideal for applications where space is limited or where higher concentrations of pollutants need to be treated. Both types of RTOs are widely used in industrial processes for air pollution control.</p></p>
