<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Reactive Waterproof Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Reactive Waterproof Coating</li><li>Dry Reactive Waterproof Coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Reactive waterproof coatings are divided into two main types - liquid and dry. Liquid reactive waterproof coatings are applied as a liquid and then cure to form a protective barrier against water penetration. They are easy to apply and can be used on various surfaces. On the other hand, dry reactive waterproof coatings come in powder form and require mixing with water before application. Once applied, they also cure to form a durable waterproof layer. Both types offer effective waterproofing solutions for different applications.</p></p>
