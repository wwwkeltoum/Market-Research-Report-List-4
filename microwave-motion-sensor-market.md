<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Microwave Motion Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pulsed Radar</li><li>Doppler-effect</li><li>Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave</li><li>Ultra-wideband</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Microwave motion sensors are divided into different types based on their working principles. Pulsed radar sensors transmit short bursts of high-frequency signals and measure the time it takes for the signal to bounce back from moving objects. Doppler-effect sensors detect motion by measuring the change in frequency of the reflected signal. Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave sensors continuously emit signals with varying frequencies to detect motion. Ultra-wideband sensors transmit signals across a broad range of frequencies to accurately measure movement with high precision.</p></p>
