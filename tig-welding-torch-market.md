<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The TIG Welding Torch Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Cooled</li><li>Air Cooled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>TIG welding torches are available in two main types: water cooled and air cooled. Water cooled torches are designed to circulate water through the torch body to dissipate heat and prevent overheating during prolonged use. These torches are typically used in high-amperage applications where heat buildup is a concern. On the other hand, air cooled torches rely on airflow to cool the torch components and are commonly used in lower-amperage applications where heat buildup is less of an issue.</p></p>
