<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oil Condition Monitoring System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-site</li><li>Off-site</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Oil Condition Monitoring Systems can be categorized into two main types: On-site and Off-site monitoring. On-site monitoring involves the installation of sensors and equipment directly at the site where the oil is being used or monitored. This allows for real-time data collection and analysis, providing immediate feedback on the condition of the oil. In contrast, Off-site monitoring involves sending oil samples to a remote laboratory for analysis, which can provide more detailed and accurate results but may have a longer turnaround time. Both types of monitoring systems play a vital role in ensuring the efficient operation and maintenance of machinery and equipment.</p></p>
