<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thyroid Function Tests Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>TSH Tests</li><li>FT4 Tests</li><li>FT3 Tests</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thyroid function tests are used to evaluate the proper functioning of the thyroid gland. The market for these tests can be segmented into three main categories: TSH tests, FT4 tests, and FT3 tests. TSH tests measure the level of thyroid-stimulating hormone in the blood, which helps identify hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. FT4 tests measure the level of free thyroxine, a thyroid hormone, while FT3 tests measure the level of free triiodothyronine, another thyroid hormone. These tests help diagnose and monitor thyroid disorders.</p></p>
