<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Choroidal Neovascularization Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intravenous</li><li>Intravitreal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV) treatment is categorized into two main market types: intravenous and intravitreal. Intravenous treatment involves administering therapeutic agents directly into the bloodstream, targeting systemic delivery for broader effects. In contrast, intravitreal treatment involves injecting medications directly into the vitreous cavity of the eye, allowing for localized and targeted action against CNV. Both methods aim to reduce the vision loss associated with conditions like age-related macular degeneration, each offering distinct benefits and applications in ocular therapy.</p></p>
