<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Triplex Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-action Design</li><li>Double-action Designs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Triplex pumps are categorized into two main types based on their design: single-action and double-action designs. In single-action pumps, the liquid is moved in one direction per stroke, while in double-action pumps, the liquid is moved in both directions per stroke. Single-action designs are commonly used in applications where lower pressure and flow rates are required, while double-action designs are preferred for higher pressure and flow rate applications. Both types offer unique advantages and cater to specific needs in the market.</p></p>
