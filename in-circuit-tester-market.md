<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The In Circuit Tester Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-Automatic</li><li>Fully-Automatic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In-circuit testers are available in two main types: semi-automatic and fully-automatic. Semi-automatic testers require manual intervention for loading and unloading of PCBs, as well as setting up the test parameters. Fully-automatic testers, on the other hand, are capable of performing tests without any manual intervention, from loading the PCB to analyzing the results. While semi-automatic testers are more cost-effective and suitable for smaller production volumes, fully-automatic testers are faster, more efficient, and ideal for high-volume production environments.</p></p>
