<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normal Phase SPE</li><li>Reversed Phase SPE</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) is a sample preparation technique used in analytical chemistry to purify and concentrate target compounds from a mixture. Two common types of SPE are Normal Phase SPE and Reversed Phase SPE. Normal Phase SPE uses a polar sorbent and non-polar solvents to separate compounds based on their polarity. Reversed Phase SPE, on the other hand, uses a non-polar sorbent and polar solvents for the separation. Both types of SPE have their own unique applications and advantages in various analytical procedures.</p></p>
