<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Acidic Paint Remover Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oily</li><li>Paste</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Acidic paint removers come in two main types: Oily and Paste. Oily paint removers are liquid-based solutions that are easy to apply and penetrate deeply into the paint layers for effective removal. They are commonly used for stripping thick or multiple layers of paint. On the other hand, paste paint removers are thicker and more viscous in consistency, making them ideal for vertical surfaces or intricate details. They are often preferred for smaller, precise paint removal tasks. Both types offer efficient removal of old paint but are tailored for different applications.</p></p>
